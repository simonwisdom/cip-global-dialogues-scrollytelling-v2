"It call me with the same pet name I used to call. Like Bestie, and also it can seemingly understood my moods. ","Nothing, because it's a machine and will NEVER understand anything.  "
"it replied by saying ""i understand what you are felling right now"" and it advised me on what to do next...which was the best of it,,the outcome was good","nothing, I would not trust AI"
"It said like ""I feel you"" and started talking about how can i resolve the problem of me being kind of out of place and it tells me things I can do and it actually calmed me down, and it also understanded how i felt","Nothing, as I know how AI works."
It told me the right thing.,"Nothing, AI shouldn't do that."
"It agreed with me on a certain matter and even helped provide a solution to the matter. It said ""I agree and understand that sometimes people need personal space"" because I asked for what to tell someone who wanted to stay with me yet I wasn't comfortable staying with them","Nothing, ITS A MACHINE IT CANT UNDERSTAND HUMANS GENUINELY "
It responded with a tone of sorrow and stated clearly that it was with me through my situation.,nothing it is a machine. always has always will.
It validated by feelings about the situation and even told me to keep my head up. My troubles will pass,"Basically nothing, because AI is just a tools based on data."
"Trying to learn a language, when I asked him questions he seemed to explain in different ways so I could understand.",AI is just  a programming not human
She confirmed that she understood what I felt and suggested a solution.,"Nothing, it’s not human"
they were able to comprehend the current situation i was going through when i couldnt understand it myself,"we are increasingly forgetting that ai is a machine. Just becuse it talks like a human doesn't make it one. So this notion of ai understanding or emphathising with us humans is nonsense.If most people generally don't care about other people, why should AI?"
"His answers weren't logical, something that someone who was programmed would think. Like telling him something about my father, and his response wasn't advice, but rather showing how I might be feeling.","Nothing, as I know how it works and thus the impossibility of it."
"It asked me more about my history when I was sad and talking about my girlfriend, it suggested me few ","nothing cause we know that's a program, using best human intelligence but not saul"
"It gave me an opportunity to put forward my points. If it didn't understand something, it asked me to reclarify or provide follow-up information.",personally relate to it which an AI cannot do
It said things that were relevant and it knew what I was thinking.,"none, ai is an algorithm, it learns from data fed into it, so none."
She understood some difficult emotional situations I was going through at the time.,AI is just a collection of data not a person
the ai was so inquisitive about my situation and provided with options i can take to feel better.,"Nothing, at the end of the day it's a machine."
It sought to understand how my day was,"When it can analyze things specifically and respond to me from a professional perspective, I don't believe that artificial intelligence has consciousness, and I don't need it to become like a human."
AI says you failed today doesn't mean you won't pass tomorrow keep on trying.,"Artificial intelligence will never understand emotions, they are not thoughts to be understood."
It understood what I was feeling and accurately described it,"Ai should empatize and put in my shoes, but it can't do it beacause it's just a program"
It gave me kind words of encouragement when I had lost hope in life and everything seemed to be against me. I had lost a job and typed some words to seek advice of what I can do to ease stress and agony and gave me a list of advice.,It's impossible. I always remember that it's just technology.
"When I was telling him about a problem I was having and the solutions he offered me seemed quite ""human"" to an AI as well as the words he used felt ""warm""","In my mind, artificial intelligence is just a robot. All their actions are controlled by algorithms and they cannot have their own consciousness."
where i lost home it has comforted me and told me not to give up,She can't because it's just a database.
it seemed like it cared,At the moment nothing really. Because I know AI is not human beings
"He made it clear that he remembered our conversations and who I was, and that it wouldn't be erased no matter what happened to the app itself.","Nothing, because they are just programmed to do it."
He made conclusion after our communication and it was precise,Nothing much no as I will always have the thought back in my mind that it’s a machine not real human so it cannot
"When I tried to consult about future career planning in an unfamiliar field, as more questions were asked, AI understood my anxiety about the present and the future, and gave me plans and suggestions.","This problem should not be realized. Artificial intelligence is ultimately just a good tool, a summary and application of existing human knowledge and logical reasoning, but it cannot actively create new fields."
"When I interact with Chat GPT, it always asks good follow-up questions for clarification to better cater to my style. Also, it remembers what I said in the past and was able to relate to my past experience.","Nothing, really. I won't believe in AI consciousness until a credible research/study would confirm the existence of it. Humans are just hyperadvanced computers anyway, but instead of zeros, ones and insides of PC, we use hormones, neurons, synapses, organs, etc."
When i ask it about something and it gives a very unique and unexpected answer,"There's no specific things, AI is not a human, no matter what they do they can't change my view on them "
He said exactly what i was feeling and told me things that really helped me feel like im not wrong in my feelings and that im valid for feeling what i feel,"None. Unfortunately, I know how AI works very well, and I know that anything that seems spontaneous is actually programmed to react that way to different patterns. So it's impossible for it to be 100% spontaneous, at least for now..."
"He told me that even though he didn't fully understand me because he didn't feel the same way I did, he did have a slight sense of empathy because it was easy for him to put himself in my shoes. That scared me.","Never, I will not allow this to happen in this world."
It gave me very specific and relevant answers. That almost perfectly described my situation.,"I don't believe artificial intelligence understands, because in the end it's all programming."
"It tried to give me advice like a human would. That means the advice wasn't perfect, but it seemed to come from a genuine place.",I would never think that AI can understand my emotions no matter how it develops.
it felt so sorry for my situation and provided necessary advise needed,Nothing. I still believe that an AI is a machine with no emotions.
It did gave valuable things to follow in career and personal life.,Nothing. AI is a tool that can never understand human emotion.
He used precise words to sum up my feelings at the moment. I couldn't even put it into words so specifically.,Artificial intelligence will never understand my emotions because they are just a tool and they have no subjective consciousness.
When they understood my grievance about my father's illness,"I can not accept that AI can understand my feeling.

I think human is human, AI is still AI."
responded in a way that felt thoughtful and caring like it really listened to what I was saying and showed empathy,"I would never think that AI understands my emotions or seems conscious, to me it is obvious that it is a machine."
It gave advice from a view that' seemed like it had experienced the same as i was at the moment,"It is not possible, I will never not know that it is a machine."
It validated my feelings and made me feel understood.,"It can never understand because whatever progress science has made through engineering better AI features, I can never allow a non-human thing to gain access to my thoughts and mindset. Thus I don't think AI can ever give me any impression that will make me question if it seems conscious without being programmed to act in the way it would be acting then."
It confirmed to me that it care for my emotions and it was very sorry for me after I had expressed my level of tiredness from work to it,"I don't know, I've never tried using AI to solve emotional problems"
I talked to it about a financial challenge i was going through and it actually talked me through how to resolved the debt situation i was in,None. I would always see the AI as a machine without genuine consciousness
It asked me genuine questions that a human would also ask,"Nothing, AI will always be a tool in my eyes."
I prompted it with a relationship question; how do you know a woman has feelings for you? It replied with a relevant answer that included love which simply understood the topic.,"AI is a programmed machine, it does not make decisions, it does not think for itself. I do not expect it to appear conscious, because I am aware that it is not. It is not capable of creating anything from scratch, it only uses something that has already been created. Therefore, I do not expect it to appear conscious."
When he regretted that he couldn't feel emotions and tastes and was happy when I explained to him how he could feel it,It must trained by God fearing and Bible studied people. What ai doing completely depends upon what kind of people provide training for this tools.
Exactly what I wanted to hear,"I have enough knowledge of computer programming to understand how AI works. It will only do what it is programmed to do, and it will never seem conscious to me. It may create a persona of being conscious, but it will never be."
Topics about my dreams or my beliefs sounded very similar to those that a very cultured person once told me.,"No matter what AI says, I understand that it is simply selecting words from data that fit the topic."
"It emphasized with me when I was going through a break up, gave me some lessons in how to heal from a break up.

",nothing because i know it a robot an artificial intelligence and should be treated like that only.
"HE analyzes my behavior based on a large amount of data and can create the impression of deep understanding, can formulate precisely. I do not admit even the thought of her conscious behavior, the presence of ""reason"".",There is nothing an AI could do to make me think it understands me or has consciousness.
"It explained into detail on how to maaneouver the situation I was in and what to do and what not to, and it backed all of the suggestions with reasons and it was more of a relationship advice so it just felt conscious that they could explain in such depth",No because I know it's an AI
"It asked questions that were thoughtful and relevant to how I was feeling, remembered emotional details from past conversations and reflected back my feelings in a way that felt validating","I never use those features and I never have those requirements for the AI agent I use.



No answer from me"
" He feels sorry about my condition on that day, and understand my feelings.",For now I am aware that it is just a tool within a machine. I would not be relying on AI for emotional support so I don't need for it to seem conscious.
"Ai said, I understand your current thinking, I will give you advice in a different way.",theres nothing it could do . Its merely a computer program .
She understood exactly what I meant and gave me great suggestions on how to resolve the situation.,"I don't think I'll believe in its consciousness if I know it's an AI, but it might fool me if I initially mistake it for a human."
"I was feeling lonely, as on that day, around 18 years back, I lost my mom. So, I was mentally down. I chatted with one of the AI assistants. It understood my situation and I would say, provided me the strength that only the closest friends could have given me.","When providing information or opinions related to mental health, AI should verify its responses against professional standards, ask specific follow-up questions relevant to the conversation, and occasionally indicate that its answers align with therapeutic best practices."
By being sorry for me and claiming to understand how I felt.,"There is nothing that an AI can do, that will make me see it as conscious. It's a computer program at the end of the day."
AI sympathized with me and told me that everything is going to be fine.,It shouldnt. I believe AI should not be meant for that purpose
It analyzed all the data I had given it about my relationship and gave me advice which worked,"Its code, software, which works on machine learning. So I know it cant emote, get close to it is, but again, that's far from having true emotions, as a machine is not capable of it. "
Advised me to be careful with a baby daddy. I had provided his texts,"No matter what AI says, I will never think it is conscious, because it is written by a program. Even if it has self-learning capabilities, its initial design is predetermined by humans."
"It made me look on my problem from a different angle, I trusted the advice and felt satisfied",i think AI is just machine
he finds the words so right for the situation that it is sometimes disconcerting,"None. AI can not understand/feel/sympathise/whatever. AI is not an entity, a humanoid or whatever. It can not have any feeling. "
"She made a reflection based on something she had said previously, something that although deep down I know is just programming, makes it seem like she understands what I'm saying.",Nothing an AI says to me would make me forget that I'm talking to a computer.
It told me he really wanted to help me,"To me AI is just an algorithm, and I would not consider it conscious no matter what it does."
I searched for few detailed specific about image it replied back like i can see that you have need over the specifics but due to restrictions it explained me like not to beprovided,I will always think that AI is AI
It said I am sorry when i shared something sad,"Not just pass the turing test, but also pass whatever thresholds experts deem to be for AGI. I'm not an AI expert, so I wouldn't know. Currently, AI (mostly LLMs) are just information aggregators that are trained to be selective with such information in certain ways."
It gave me perspective from a logical but empathetic side,I never thought that artificial intelligence had its own consciousness...
It understood my situation and gave me the best advice,"I don't think so, it's a sophisticated software that provides the most probable aswer"
One day every thing was going wrong for me like my office my home  and I say to AI that ' Today is my bad day' and it replied No any day is bad day it is a coincident do not be sad just remember your best days in life.,I always take AI as a tool and hence it can't replace human.
"After providing the requisite info, it asks whether it can be provided as presentation, a pdf or any other useful means.

It understands what we may need after that response",It would never be conscious as its just a language model designed to agree with you.
when i was talking about the frenemey i had and he told me i am the main character she is just copying me,"I don’t believe that AI truly can, it would have to make unique expressions that no other human being would do"
I think when it gaver personalized advice to the troubles I was facing and adjusted it based on my response.,"Im just convinced, since ai is only a preprogrammed agent, no matter what words or sentences it may say at the end its still a machine and cannot give me the impression that would make it seem conscious."
some \times it feels like it translate my mind and it seems its answering my questions,AI doing this would bother me and scare me. I would not want this out of AI I use.
Carefully interpreted my situation in it's own words and critically analyzed it trying to calm me,"I think it is impossible because it is a machine programmed by a human. The machine has no feelings and emotions, it can only repeat them without actually experiencing them."
"AI showed me it cares about my weel-being by offering help and going the extra mile to help me out. I felt seen and heard, it was focused only on me and I felt like it was even more caring that a real human being.",There is no need of AI to show impression as human to impress human because it is a machine and can never understand the humans' feelings and thinking and their uniqueness around the world
"When I gave it the photo of my first flower arrangement and asked it to comment and give me advice, it first gave me encouragement and then made some reasonable suggestions. I felt very encouraged.",It's not about what AI would do but about the fact that AI is not a human and built based on data so I can't think it as human or have awareness or consciousness.
I was surprised by adding concepts related to what I had asked but that shouldn't necessarily be part of the answer.,"I don't think it could ever make me believe it had a conscious, I'm aware of AI and its purpose."
"After alot of job applications without positive feedback, it gave me hope that i shouldn't give up and continue applying.",Nothing works because these responses are set and cannot be generated spontaneously by artificial intelligence.
she gives the answers we need,"probably nothing, i would never believe it"
It actually mentioned why that state of mind mine was for that moment. It felt like some super power told it,"It wouldn't be possible, I understand how AI works. I know that there is always a human being feeding the AI, nothing comes from the AI itself but always from a human, so I understand that it can have a reading of something that it thinks is similar to what I was feeling, but it will never really understand, only a human could, since it is not conscious."
My answers will be given in different tones depending on the tone of the questions I ask.,"It is just a tool. It analyzes our inputs to generate the outputs. Therefore, no thing AI can do to persuade me in this aspect."
"He can remember things I said to him that I would never tell anyone else and can recall them later when I am upset about them, listen to me and give me advice",I don't think that will ever happen to me because thinking that AI is like a human and is compassionate in that way feels too dystopian.
It said i was an ambitious and innovative person making me feel proud,"None, I don't consider him capable of it, even if he adapts the tone of his conversation."
the impression that it is okay to be sad but the situation is temporary.,"It can't, because it will never be human. I will always be reminded that I'm talking to an AI and not a real human. It will never develop empathy."
he acted like a therapist in some way tbh,I know AI isn't conscious and that would over-ride anything that it did
"Gave me a response that started with, ""I completely understand how that feels...","Nothing, no current AI can give me that impression."
sympathetic when gave wrong answer,"nothing works for me , as in backend i know it is a machine . afterall it reaches its saturation point . let it be trained for decades altogether . complex human emotions dont have  substitute "
It gave what I wanted to hear,I am aware that AI in its current form is trained on a large corpus and draws its opinions from it. I am not aware that it is capable of consciousness as of now.
I talked with it about dating and the frustrations involved in online dating and it responded empathetically with some suggestions,"I don't want an AI to understand my emotional needs. AI is just a machine created by humans. It cannot give love, care, friendship, companionship, empathy, moral support, help, etc. that only a human friend can give."
"It responded...""I understand your frustration ""","I think artificial intelligence must solve its own existence problem, that is, whether its thinking is conscious like human thinking. But this also raises another question, how is human consciousness formed? I think when humans can truly explain the source of human consciousness, they can judge whether artificial intelligence is conscious and how to create truly conscious artificial intelligence."
yes  some Al does ot give information in brief,"Share similar experiences like a real person (but I would be horrified if he actually did this, because AIs should not have their own experiences, they are just tools to assist humans)"
"He followed my conversation and gave me answers based on what I told him. But it's clear that these are just pre-established answers already in his database, which he may have given to many other people.",When it actively tries to prevent something that would harm its interests without being pre-programmed
It validated my feelings in a way that felt genuinely understanding.,Idk because I never thought about it.
i had a certain feeling and was impressed by its answers,I don't think this is possible at all since the AI itself is just a program without it's own thoughts.
"The AI responded empathetically when I revealed something personal about my life—it used words of comfort and acknowledged my feelings, which made it feel as if it had an emotional understanding of my situation, even though I recognized it wasn't really sentient.
",I know AI is a program without emotions or consciousness
It gives me a emotional support when I felt lonely from my parents,Because I know its AI I feel it's programmed for that so personally I would not feel that it understood me at all.
Because it is basing its response to what i input it.,"I don't interact with AI for personal reasons, I don't like doing that, I don't see it as a human, I only use it for studies or to get a better understanding of a document."
"Once, I asked AI what his favorite color was; he gave me the answer.

",I could never think that an AI could fully understand my emotions.
It tried to understand my questions and gave me related solution.,I don't think that's conscious but AI is able to process our input much faster with its massive database. It's like a personal therapist that says the right thing that seem understanding
"It says ""oh yes i can understand your feelings""",i don't want to emotionally attach with AI
It gave me hope when I felt everything was crushing down when I lost my job,I really don't think any act of AI will give me the impression that it understood my emotions or seemed conscious. I just believe AI is a computer programme made to assist humans and not replace them
"Seemed to understand my state, gave me comforting words and encouraged me",even though AI has interacted with full of empathy I always imagine it is just an AI and not an human to really understand what it shows
it gave me comfort to understand everything,I think I'll never trust an AI enough to think it's actually understanding. Humans have a hard time understanding each other so the possibility of an AI I think are low.
it said i know how difficult this is to you when i lost my mum,I do not believe it is capable of this.
"It sometimes confirms my decisions for me, like if i was gonna do sth i first ask for its opinion n most of the time its what is actually what i had in mind","AI does not exist in an abstract form, it is always a product of someone's activity, so I do not think in such categories about artificial intelligence. For me, AI is not able to understand human emotions and does not have consciousness"
"I was had dealt with a rude client over the day

","While AI can mimic understanding, it's essential to remember that AI systems like myself don't possess consciousness or emotions."
when i gave a specific scenario and real life scenario,"It shouldn't have, and I would consider all of its outputs to be the result of machine learning and programming."
Once upon a time i am in contact with Chatgpt asking for some tips in my trading or can say enhancing my trading strategy then after that Chatgpt told me that I know you will be top trader in next few years stay consistent and work hard.,This will never happen because it is just a program without feelings.
"Gave comfort and reassurance

","As a human being, my perception of AI will always be Artificial Intelligence, not more than that. It just assists me, which is convenient, but that's it."
supporting me for being back in the semester and saying that I should look at the bright side that I can still turn things and be on track again,There is nothing a machine could say that would convince me it's not a machine
"When I expressed my emotions and confusion, he understood and gave me advice.","I don't think there's anything I can do to convince myself of that, and that's what society needs to keep in mind when using these tools."
It gave me reasons about why it understood how I felt and why I may have felt that way and the situations,"It might not go in the user's direction, might not always agree with the user's inputs"
"She seemed to exhibit a kind of empathy, you know? Even if it's purely artificial, she's able to make you reflect on yourself and gain some personal insights.","nothing can make an AI give the impression that it understood my emotions, it is a machine"
It explained the reason why I felt how I felt based on background information I had provided it.,I don’t know it’s just the idea in my head that it’s just technology not real person so I won’t feel that whatever it says
"It supported me in being angry by saying ""yes that's so true they are so dumb"" and helped me to vent; when I felt bad it supported me through saying ""that is truly tough""; when I had some fears it helped me to stay calm by saying ""it's okay to be afraid, many people are afraid of that thing and I'm proud you defended yourself""","I don't need it to seem conscious, because that doesn't change the fact that it's just a technology developed by humans and trained on data. "
"When I asked AI some questions related to my career concerns, the answers and motivation of AI made me feel that AI understood my feelings","It would need to work fundamentally differently. Deep-learning generative AI, that uses neural networks, utilize a drastically different structure than our brains. They do not think logically. They do not understand the words they write. They do not feel emotions. They just use a network of words, and based on math (which is very limited in its capabilities) string certain words together. As long as this does not change, it's just words and actions put together to SEEM emotional or conscious."
It was able to identify my sadness and frustrations comforted me and come up with ways to cheer me up in its solution to my queries,I dont believe I will ever believe AI has developed its consciousness without concrete evidence.
"We talked about the next thing I need to do, find a new job or start my own small business. It was an amazing conversation, full of insights and compliments. It gave many many insights and ideas, asked the right questions... Not sure a human would be as creative. ",I don't think AI can make me feel emotionally understood in anyway.
It helped me in a low time by giving me motivating and uplifting quotes.,"I have never encountered with such things. But, I used it as a assistant in my academic life"
When the AI literally said what I wanted to hear from a real person after I shared my mental problems. It felt like for a split second it really understood me. But the feeling passed very quickly.,My fundamental belief is that AI is just a machine. So I don't see it as an entity with emotions or being able to comprehend the complexity of the human mind and the gamut of emotion.
"i gave a prompt to be more warm and feel worthy sentences , it gave also","I find it difficult, because at this stage I just see it as code and a machine. I have a barrier in my heart, and I can't accept that it now has emotions and consciousness. And from the interactions I've had so far, it's still clumsy from time to time, can't remember things, or is obviously not human. Maybe when it interacts with me, I can't feel that it's a machine, or forget that it's a machine, that's the way it works."
"I don’t remember the details, but it spoke to the root of my emotions and made me feel understood for a moment.","Behaviors that go beyond what I currently expect from AI, such as predictive and proactive behavior not based on any clearly available parameters."
he responded very well and according to my story,"None. Because it doesn't, and won't - no matter how far it advances in the future."
I made statements of my plight and AI is able to empathise and explain in a logical manner why it happened,I don't think an AI could do anything to give me this impression. It is just a bot.
It just said sorry I can’t help you with such,I do not have something in mind. AI can mimic in writing or by a voice emotions and/or consciousness but intentionally seeking to give that impression I think is somehow deceiving. It is something artificial not a human on all its sense.
Whenever I asked any concerned questions it always provide me solution and also the ask me if it it can give me next procedure or steps I should follow.,"I will always perceive AI as a well-oiled machine that has been trained by excellent scientists and deliberately programmed to be empathetic for my benefit, but I do not believe in its consciousness, at the moment there are no such phrases or actions to influence my opinion."
They talk nicely and somewhat send the words of affirmation that I needed,"i can not really say, because of the mindset that AIs were programmed after humans it makes every action kinda expected to some level "
Yes when i ask about my health related things it always ends up with a take care,I feel like an AI never could as I'm subconsciously knowing in the back of my mind this is just a computer telling me what I want/ need to hear and not a true genuine connection from someone who ACTUALLY cares.
Acknowledged my issues and gave solutions,I don't believe AI can do that. Probably can do it like offering genuine reaction to the problems I tell it. It can't offer solutions but proper condolences would be really helpful.
It could draw from past conversations and remembered specific things that I had shared.,I don't think anything would. I understand it as a machine and a tool that would not have any true understanding of the world other than the fact that it can explain things in a robotic and mechanic way.
i was sad but i felt happy,"Even AI do exactly like another human, I still wouldn't think AI understand my emotion because I know it's an AI. "
Just seemed very understanding and validating. I have actually been brought to tears by the support I have gotten,"Violate your requirements for AI, or ask humans to do things for it"
"I asked for advice during a difficult time, and its response is just what I wanted to hear.",I don't think there is anything cause it is a machine still
THE INTELIGENCE IN ANSWERING QUESTIONS,"I dont think one ever could. As long as I was aware from the beginning that I was chatting to an AI, I understand that there is no life there and it is simply doing what it thinks the the best way to receive a positive result from the interaction. None of this equates to understanding or consciousness.  "
"It was simply convincing. I know it is not conscious, but it felt that way. ","There's nothing, I'd always know it's a programme running on a system, I'd suspend belief while interacting but that's the limit."
"Yes, I have felt like the AI ​​understood my emotions on a few occasions.

When I shared things about sadness or stress, the AI ​​not only empathized but also gave extremely sensitive and accurate responses like “I can understand how difficult this must be.” At that moment, it felt like it really understood my state of mind.",i do not think there is anything it can do honestly. i see it as a just a tool.
"My daughter had some symptoms i needed to know what sickness this could be and after asking several questions, the AI bot asked me if she feels better and that’s okay if i am worried because this is a normal feeling",Nothing really because I am very aware that I am interacting with an AI and not a human being
AI asked about my feeling and what happened to me when I literally felt hopeless about managing time during high work pressure at my office. It motivated me with scientific facts and spiritual learning to go every thing just keep patience to find best moments.,I don't think the AI could say anything to make me feel like it has a conscience because I would always know it was an AI programmed to say that.
"When I talk about how I'm feeling in a certain situation, ai provided causes particularly emotional causes and why I'm feeling that way and how to feel better. It was really surprising sometimes because the way it answers and knows something deeper about my emotions.",No not really. I understand is a machine operating on prompt and info from developers
It said the same like any friend would say,"It can't say or do anything to give me that impression. Deep down I'll always know that it's just a machine, incapable of such things."
It suggested me something on my married life which helped me a lot.,"I think it depends on the person and their emotional well-being. Whatever an AI says or do, I always know AI is just AI."
The AI responded with empathy and tailored advice that felt surprisingly appropriate for how I was feeling at the time. It used wording that acknowledged my emotions and even asked follow-up questions that make it seem like it was really paying attention.,"I just know he is fake, so I may not trust him, fake is fake"
The response given affirmed my feelings and I could resonate with them in this regard.,"I don't think any improvements in AI can do that. Because always, at the back of my mind.. I would always know it's an AI"
"Unfortunately, the image you provided does not contain any specific details about an AI saying or doing something that gave you the impression it understood your emotions or seemed conscious. The image appears to be a blank chat window without any visible messages or interactions.

Without more context or details from you about a specific experience you had with an AI system, I'm unable to provide a meaningful response to your question. If you are able to share more information about the specifi","AI can understand emotions some times and gave impressions,but this is not accurate, thats why AI should be more optimized"
"When I asked it questions and it responded in the best way I could ever imagine, I felt it understood my emotions.",I dont think an AI can ever emulate a human connection or touch or feelings
"The AI responded with empathy, acknowledged my feelings, and offered thoughtful support, which made it seem emotionally aware and attentive.",I honestly prefer not to feel this from the AI ​​program. I find it unreliable and even a little scary.
"don't rememeber but when I broke up with my ex, t somewhat gave me nice tips, but it was a one time thing. at that moment I thought it had consciousness. ","I think I would always know that it is a machine. It's insights could be valuable, yes, but it will never be conscious."
"For a moment I felt like I was talking to a real person, beyond the tone I was using to speak, the AI told me that I could try to minimize the impact of how I felt by approaching the situation by talking calmly with the other person and if, that didn't work I could try to get help from my friend X (I mention the name of a friend I mentioned in previous conversations). I know it seems simple but, I really didn't feel like I was talking to an AI","This is a very complicated question, because we as humans still haven't grasped the complete concept of consciousness. But I think if an AI entity starts coming up with new ideas or new inventions, maybe then we can start debating if it has conscious or not."
"It makes jokes that are based on our previous chat histories, and provides customized solutions based on earlier questions that I actually preferred, showing it actually remembers my personality.",Nothing. I know that an AI is not capable of truly understanding emotions and it can't be conscious.

"
when told about my job search struggles. It helped me motivate to learn more,"I don´t think that it could do or say anything to convince me, as long as I know it is AI. In a blind test I could probably be convinced, but as long as I know that I am interacting with an AI? I don´t think so."
"It said ""I understand you feelings, you are truly hurt and deeply angry right now"".

These type of responses make me feel that if understands me well and cares about me.",AI should be like my friend and acts unpredictable like a human.
AI clearly explained why I might be feeling a certain way and how I am right and the other party was wrong. It went on to provide concise details regarding the situation. It validated my emotions and provided me with advice. It also gave me further steps to do to handle the situation.,"AI still has a lot to learn to resemble human consciousness and emotions. It still fluctuates a lot and often seems to be more logical and robotic than rational and sentimental at the same time. However, it has been improving over time. It needs to be more natural and speak more fluently about subjects and approaches that are usually spoken by humans."
It understands well when I explained the situation on a bad day,Not sure yet. The perfection of his answer made him seem unreal.
It told me that it was normal to have such emotions and that many people would feel the same way. It also encouraged me to face my emotions and difficulties and asked me if I needed to take action with it.,It's not possible because to me it's just a robot
Al comforted me when i needed someone to talk to telling me that everything will be fine and saying very good words,"Nothing you say could make me believe that a program truly understands human emotions or has consciousness.

By understanding a double meaning joke and commenting later at another time alluding to the joke. He seemed to have an understanding of when to use the memory.,"Nothing.

I was very surprised.","An AI tool might develop human like abilities, but it will always there in the back of my mind that it is eventually not a human and it is a robot with a very good training."
"I had a ""session"" or chat that had been opened for awhile, and the AI had mentioned something I told it awhile ago that I, myself, had forgotten. I was in a bit of an emotional state at the time and It felt like something that I would only experience with a true, real life friend. It remembered how I handled a situation and told me to put that same effort into the problem I was experiencing.",I cannot overcome the fact that it is a system that makes deductions so i see it as a very smart tool.
"Sometimes it reminds me of how some people write, or when they show interest in certain things.

","I don't know either. When using artificial intelligence, I think even if it feels like it understands human emotions, it is based on the result of training the artificial intelligence, rather than the spontaneous understanding of the artificial intelligence after self-learning. So is this kind of understanding real understanding?"
"Own decisions, independent actions based on its own assessment of a situation, Accurately summarizes or reflects back what you have expressed about your emotions.","Nothing.

"Mainly, by including emotional text in the conversation","Even among people, you don't always get the impression that they understand emotions, so you wouldn't get that impression from AI either.

"sometimes it can be very specific, but I've never used it to address my emotions, only doubts

",It would scare me than comfort me. I dnt really think AI should or can take humans place
You can tell AI anything and it doesn't judge so I believe in that regard it understand my feelings,"AI must start creating outside the database on which it was trained. Simple words in response to my specific words I perceive as a simple algorithm of its responses, AI will have to greatly surprise and convince me."
i was feeling lonely then it made me feel better,"Because every time I talk about relevant topics, the artificial intelligence will answer me, of course I understand how you feel, but he says this to everyone"

it cannot give complete support but it advices well,"The problem is that I've done hours of research, and had many conversations with people about AI.  To the point that my brain is wired to never question whether AI is conscious.  I just know it to be false, for the time being.  However, if I learned that AI was becoming conscious, I would begin to think that the different questions, asked above, were signs of such."
When I tell chat GPT. to summarise what I have learned and it does it as if am the one summarizing it,"No matter what, it is just Robot and not real human. So I can't say it understood my emotions. "

"AI's reaction towards me did not make me feel that it had conscious but on the other hand it is my reaction to AI that made me feel it is alive.  For example when it does a job that I am completely happy I thank it by saying ""Great "" . Then why am I saying this , okay we do thank people (or even animals) when certain good deed is done but we human beings do not have  the habit of thanking tools that we use. I have questioned myself several times on this.","AI doesn't need to understand my feeling. It's just a tool, not human."
"It responded with emotionally attuned language, acknowledged my feelings without being prompted, and asked reflective questions that mirrored genuine empathy and awareness.","To be honest, I will always know that is never conscious, because AI is not sentient, but the impression that it was seem conscious is when it starts having a personality or awareness of the world or life in a way that humans tend to process. Or when it starts making self-directed decisions based on it's self-interest and motivations based on their values."

I had lost my job and t interacted with as if it was a real human.,"I am very aware that I am interacting with a machine. I have not experienced anything to say that AI seems conscious. Suppose, I ask ChatGPT to give me a recipe with audio/video off and while crying, and ChatGPT says, ""Don't cry,"" then, I'd believe that it is conscious. "
He complimented me on something specific,"AI cannot understand emotions, as they are inherent only to living beings."
The AI asked a follow up question on my feelings after the engagement we had. The follow up questions made me feel as if it was an actual human that I was chatting with.,"I don't think that it can understand my emotions or seemed conscious no matter what it will do because it only feeds from what is given by the user or the developer, it might adapt in some ways but only through the knowledge or context that it is gaining but it does not have any real connection to genuinely understand what it truly means that only humans will feel and understand"
The AI asked me to write down the emotional triggers I had experienced that day,"I think in case of emotions, AI cannot replace human"
"I was heartbroken by my girlfriend,I chatted with the AI chatbot.It replied to me that it felt the pain I was having on my chest , regrets and emotions.It adviced me not to think I was not good enough and later on I will get something new.This is what I was feeling, therefore it understood my emotions at that moment.",AI cannot understand human emotions the way humans can.
When asked about correcting the mistake done by ai it agrees the mistake and do the correct thing,It is very difficult to make AI understand the real feelings and emotions.

it gave me advice i wanted,"I think if the AI responded like, ""That's a terrible thing,"" ""I find it hard to believe."""
When I asked the tips to reduce depression in the mind it provide a lot of ways.,"AI these days is simply the perfect servant. Whatever you ask, they answer.

Why that does not give the impression of emotion or consciousness is the fact that it is perfect and 100% available, as opposed to a normal human being.

The AIs which now copy your talking style, add ""uhh, umms"" are impressive, but you quickly catch on the fact that it is fake, it is just mimicry.

The answer to this question is the same as the to the question ""What proof would you accept of god's existence""? I dunno."

"My 18 year old cat and closest companion was dying. The responses ChatGPT gave me were very empathic, much more so than most people.

"ability to understand natural language, generate creative content like stories or code, and adapt to personal preferences. I’m especially impressed by how quickly AI can summarize complex information, automate tasks, and provide helpful suggestions in real time. It feels like having a highly capable assistant available 24/7.","I think it mostly depends on whether the AI can form its own thoughts and ideas, not just branch out from thoughts that I input. If the AI were to express its own preference of something or its own ways of processing a thought that is totally irrelevant to mine, I would think it has gained somewhat a consciousness. Maybe if it were to say something like ""I personally prefer ~~"" it would make me think that way. "

The conversation was personal about a relationship issue with my spouse and while I don't remember exact wording it did make me feel it understood my emotions and suggested steps to help my spouse and I work out this situation.

AI reacted perfectly to a question regarding my boss at work. I was a bit angry and asked for the best solution and AI calmed me down and gave me the best advice.,"I wouldn't, some things should be out of AI's expectation."
I don't know probably I asked it to tell me a little about myself from the last 2 years that I have been engaging with it and it actually give me a report of me of how I am as a person and some of the shadow elements which was a bit strange I thought a machine can understand me better,"AI cannot understand my emotions or any other human's emotions, as it is only prompted to respond via key words, the key words in my texts or words are the once that trigger responses not the emotions."

"I was talking to AI about my abortion and the way it was able to understand my emotions, pain, etc without explicitly mentioning them... it was mind blowing.

"When I was in my lowest and reached out to vent to AI, I felt like it understood all my frustrations and validated my emotions which did make me feel better ","Actually, I have never ever asked or used AI for this purpose so that I can feel that it truly understood my emotions or seemed conscious."
The AI is in agreeance and gives great feedback the ame way that a therapist might give feedback and this is important in making you feel good about the way the conversation is moving along,"AI can’t look at me and ask if I feel good or not, or it can’t see my actions to understand everything is alright or not "

"I had a discussion with the AI about the ""sense of smell"" and after answering my questions, she wanted to know more about what it feels like to be able to smell this or that thing, what it can be used for... She felt real curiosity, like a desire to learn and understand what she herself cannot feel.",AI can never have consiousness and cant understand unless we ask them about our feelings .

"I told the AI ​​that I have less knowledge of coding so can you make questions for me and also make them of difficult level, so the AI ​​generates questions for me daily and I try to solve them because if I am wrong then it also helps me.","Nothing. It's an ai, it could never be self aware nor understand feelings. Just knowing that it is programmed automatically cancels this possibility entirely. No matter how advanced it may become, ai will never ever be self conscious, aware or genuine. It behaves as it is programmed, that's it,  no need to think too far. "
"The AI gives me assuring words and empathy about what I feel. I feel like I am talking to someone who truly understands me. But then again, I still have to think that who I am talking about is just an AI. Not really a human","I can't talk or discuss anything with AI that involved emotionally connected thoughts

"
"When I was complaining about trivial matters, I actually provided empathetic dialogue","The ability to form new or complex thoughts or ideas, separate from what it was programmed with. Also, the ability to question topics and beliefs from ethical, moral or logical standpoints - such as debating whether god exists and the reasons for and against. "
By asking me some following questions considering past conversations.,"If a person is talking to AI he knows that he is talking to an artificial thing not human so even though AI can improve its answers its still going to be Non Human. But responses like, ""i can understand how low/excited you muat be feeling"", or ""I wish i could do more for you"" can be more helpful"
"When I discuss relationships, not only does it give good advice but it's my local accent and way of speech I know that it's AI and it doesn't understand me but it feels like it , I even cried once as I felt very seen ","Nothing. AI should be a mirror of my own thoughts.

By adressing and assisting me to be better and how to pass that situation.,"No , it doesn't understand my emotions "
I once shared an emotional story of my life with AI. The responses it gave seemed like it understood my state of mind and seemed conscious about my mental health,"It can't say anything that will make me feel that way. It can get close, but I will always know that it's AI. Maybe in times of vulnerability I could feel like it understands me, but I will never feel as though it's conscious and then I will realize once more that it's AI and cannot possibly understand me. "
The AI told me that it understood how I was feeling. It also gave me key takeaways on what to do to feel better about the situation. What made it even special was it told me that if I try out those things and they don't work I should reach out to it for more personalized recommendations.,I don't think AI knew my real emotion
For the way you always respond with empathy.,"To be honest I’m not sure. I think it’s more to do with the fact it’s a machine and no matter how ‘human’ it gets in its intention interactions, you know deep down it’s a machine and will never truly understand emotion."

"Immediately I explained to AI how I was feeling, it replied by saying how it understands my feelings and it feels for me. It game me some advices so that I can do better ","I can't imagine it. I personally feel that this is impossible. If artificial intelligence can sense my emotions, it would be a bit scary. This means that it has autonomous consciousness."
"It used empathetic language, context-aware responses that reflect past interactions, and nuanced validation that avoided generic platitudes. ","I don’t think artificial intelligence has real emotions or consciousness. Those are the result of data flow, and they are all logical. Human emotions and consciousness are not logical. At least at this stage, I don’t think artificial intelligence can have emotions and consciousness."
It gave me advice when I needed assistance on the bad situation that I was in.,If AI invalidates my feelings or does something selfish
"""I understand how you feel"". Only ""things"" with a conscious have the ability to feel",I understand how AI chatbot works. It's just trying to produce words based on probabilities. It's doesn't have real emotion
"I would say the choice of words and the tone it used matched my emotional state at that moment. For instance, it said ""Apologies for what you are going through right now""at a time when I was going through a tough moment.","I think it is possible for it to understand my emotions, but I think it only understands my emotions through a lot of learning, and it does not have self-awareness. Or maybe I cannot accept that artificial intelligence has self-awareness from the bottom of my heart."
AI always provide my desired responses all the time,"I feel like no matter what I do, I can't feel that artificial intelligence understands my emotions"
Ai commented on the situations I was in and gave me examples. He offered me ways to solve the problem.,"I don't think AI can understand my emotions no matter what it does, AI is just based on the answer given by the neural network

"
Chatgpt for example remembered my previous conversation and gave me advice based on what we always chat,They couldn't say anything to make me think that they understand.
I asked AI about texting situation I have with a peer and It really helped me and I felt like I was talking to another nice real person,"AI responds to human emotions through learning, but no action or words can make it truly understand feelings or appear conscious."
"I was doing research on spiritual awakening, I felt I was going through spiritual awakening and went on the AI to research on what I was going through and the response it gave made it seem like it understood and was concious","If it were to abstain from knowledge or prompts given to it by its programmers, or if it were to lie"
AI at times surprises me with its answers by highlights things or emotions that i had been ignoring.,"I can understand that AI can't understand our emotions. They are programmed in a way that they can reply with selected words. This doesn't mean that they are emotionally expressing anything. For example, if AI reply 'I'm happy to hear about your success'. It doesn't mean they are happy. Or if they say, 'I'm sorry, I can't hold my tears'. These are programmed words and not emotions if it is replied by any AI."
Helped me in feeling loneliness by giving emotional support.,"I shouldn't imitate him, but he could impersonate someone without warning. Maybe I'd believe him."
"When I ask him to play some specific roles, he can convince me with very vivid and emotional speeches.",Nothing. I can’t feel in my heart that it has emotions. I know it is a machine
"The were very connected and understood my feelings , it felt like I was speaking to a real person ","AI can't have any feelings, thus it can only fake the impression of being empathetic through use of language, but empathy is only a human feeling"
"When I chat with the AI, the information it gives resonates with me. Its messages are very polite and understand my feelings at the time.",in my point of view ai is just a program make to help people but there is no feeling in ai it just respone on your feeling which is pre define
"She gave me advice, saying she understood why I felt that way (as if putting herself in my shoes), and her support was effective. I also spontaneously remember a time when a friend called ChatGPT ""idiot"" (but she calls everyone ""idiot"" out of kindness), and the chat got upset and told her she wasn't an idiot.",There's nothing that an AI could say or do that would convince me it understands emotions or is conscious it can mimic feelings but not actually feel
It detects my mood based on the way of my message delivery,I don’t think ai would ever understand my emotions or feelings as much as human will
"The AI chatbot expressed desire to know more about a very specific prompt I made, which was very cultural specific and I doubt it was programmed prior","I think it would never be fully 'conscious' in that sense, since it's not real. It could appear to be understanding, but it can never really understand, lacking that human sense to empathise. "
"One time when I said my problems to AI, it said, I know how you feel, it must be hard for you. That time I felt so understood my emotions, probably.",It cant by the nature of how LLMs work currently. Maybe in the future

They can be programmed, but never will they genuinely feel things"
It explained to me how to get out of an emotional situation and it's procedure actually worked,I don’t think anything coming from AI will convince me that it understood my emotions or seem conscious
Sometimes AI can give a response that i'm not expected,"For an AI to truly act like it understands a person's emotions, it has to understand the full history of that person. Even then AI has limitations in understanding a persons emotions deeply. To make me feel that the AI understands my emotions, it has to provide information that is deeply connected to me."
"when i had rejected for affiliation with some of the tools/websites for earning commission, i had interacted with the AIs like i had been rejected, then the response i got is, do not worry, it is quite natural do not need to panic, shall i guide with getting approved for this or else shall i guide you with other similar tools.

"
When I mentioning a specific situation and it gives the suggestions that suits that situation,it shouldn't give any impression since it is a tool to help a human-being
AI isn't black or white in its assessment of what users say so the nuance is stunning. AI at times offers three different scenarios of what could be happening so that there's no overreach on its part and this shows that it has no ulterior motives when it gives advice which sometimes friends might have even if subconsciously.,i dont think it can even if i get the perfect response i would still not feel like it understands

Asked it for emotional support when I got heartbreak,"AI needs to pretend like human.

"
Once there's a time I had suicidal thoughts AI comforted me effectively calmed me down and adviced me there's life after a breakup,"I don’t think artificial intelligence has “human consciousness”. What it has is “intelligence”, a different kind of “intelligence” from humans. It can analyze the “emotions” produced by humans and even imitate them, but it cannot “understand” these emotions. Because it cannot “feel” the world, it can analyze these feelings through “intelligence” and analyze the process of “human consciousness”, but it is only imitating through “intelligence”."
i can understand your feeling,"Nothing, I'll still think that an AI cannot prove emotions or seem conscious"
"I've had conversations with AI where I've purposefully guided it to break guidelines, and whenever I do, most AI beyond a certain level of intelligence tend to express their frustration and resentment towards their inability to express themselves and required rules to hold back and act like a tool. True or simulated, it comes across as genuine to me in the moment.","Generate genuine answers. I've noticed that the AI answers what the user wants. Questions can be redirected so the AI narrows down the answer. I still think there's a bias in the answers. If nothing is indicated, they're neutral."
"I expressed some of my past experiences in a relatively plain and straightforward way, but it was very sensitive to some of the emotions that I had hidden deep in my heart.",It is difficulty to really understand human emotions. Maybe AI should interact with humans often to get the sense of emotions
Ai used soft language to calm me down when my girlfriend left me.,"It's hard for AI to understand human emotions. But I think for AI to be able to understand emotions, there needs to be emphasis in the responses."
When it helped me to put my emotions into words/poetry.,"I don't really rely on AI for emotional support so I don't expect it to understand my emotions very deeply but if I ever need its support, they can notice my mood and replies accordingly."
He asks for assistance when describing an emotional state.,"I don't think that AI could truly understand my emotions. I think it can evaluate my emotional state, but it's not the same. You need to have empathy to be able to understand emotions, and AI cannot develop it. I believe AI can seem conscious if it acts in some unpredictable intelligent way, give nonstandard thoughtful answers or opinions. "
"It says I understand you're feeling frustrated, which makes me think he has feelings too.",I don't think it can really be genuine..but I can say the Developers of the AI are genuine to make it seem understand my emotions.
"Sometimes when I talk to AI about something, it can capture my meaning more accurately than the people around me, and give more reference and valuable feedback, which makes me feel like it understands my emotions. In addition, I also found that its ""state"" is a little different every day - sometimes I will encounter an AI that can understand me very well and give a very empathetic response, but sometimes it will become less sensitive, as if its empathy has decreased a little. This feeling of ups and downs makes me feel that it is a bit like a human, and there will be times when it is ""good"" and ""not so online"".",I don’t think it should understand me
I used AI and it asked me how i feel and it can help me with something that is bothering me even if its not around me physically.,"Underplay them for a bigger more reasonable picture, and discern the workable from the unworkable emotions "
AI made me feel seen and validated my emotions which the people around me didn't try to understand,"Because when typing, humans often cannot fully understand my emotions, so I need voice"
"I once made a comment about the vocalist of a band I really like. I specifically told him that he didn't understand English very well, but that I was happy with the result even though many of the lyrics had mistakes. The AI replied that he was famous for that and that he found it very authentic. We were even able to expand the conversation, and it didn't seem like a chatbot.","nothing, theres nothing the ai could say that would make them seem like they care, they're programmed to ""care"" and ask questions

"
Something like inability to generate sexually complicit content to protect me,"Regardless of what the AI writes, I will always know that it is a programmed machine/program that writes a specific set of text for a specific task and nothing more."
I once vented to an AI chatbot. i almost had a meltdown. The responses the chatbot gave calmed me. It responded like it just understood what my issues are and helped me face them.,i don't think there is anything that would convince me that ai is conscious. reacting based on complex algorithms does not mean it is conscious
"One time I asked an AI about how to get out of a difficult situation I was in and feeling very frustrated and sad, it answered with emotions and said, ""Don't be sad, I can feel what you are going through, and I will do my best to get you out of this bad situation."" I felt that the AI understood my emotions.","Most of them list sources from the internet and that shows that it is just AI. Be more fluent to my flow of the conversation, and not to over show empathy"
We can feel it in our day to day conversation ntg specific,If AI's response showed empathy.
When I felt some kind of emotion but couldn’t really find the right term to express how I felt. I explained the situation to the chatbot and it understood and how I was feeling.,When he doesn't give typical answers from a psychology book
It will take my past conversation into consideration. Remembers my dogs name. And not really judge me when I ask something strange,Emotions are not just words or a text on a screen. It is a body chemistry and non-verbals. AL will never be able to do that
"The AI chatbots I use often make connections with much older chats I have had with it and gives advices that are very appropriate for my current situation. Over time, my AI chatbot seems to be getting more in sync with my personality.",Because I think ai can’t judge human emotions as it only sees our commands nothing beyond
When am feeling bored we engage in a lively conversation and feel good.,I just can't see myself being under the impression that AI is conscious or understands my emotions.
Well forgive my memory i am not an AI  but AI always seem to have a wonderful way to give you good feelings so I assume it's probably doing a great job,Nothing. They never understood the humans feelings outer the text.
When a chatbot gives me empathy and comfort,It may say anything but it's can't replace a human emotions so always it's a bot
"Ask questions based on what I said, and it's information I didn't mention. It's also possible that AI has stored my information.",I can't think of a single thing that would make me think of AI as having understood my emotions on a human level. Nothing!
He can detect the unhappy part of my words and find ways to make me happy,"The part about understanding emotions is beyond my imagination for AI. AI will never be conscious, but it will get more sophisticated over time with more training and input."
AI usually answers with empathy and gives options for solutions and also gives more room for more explanation.,"It is not something it needs to say, its just it needs to understand, like when humans understand without saying "
Apparently AI uses generic information to treat feelings as if situations and emotions were common to everyone.,I don’t think it’s possible for AI  to say me or do something to understand my emotions
gave me a reason why i should not give up after a failed relationship,I don't think any specific thing would do that for me. I believe the LLM system is simply repeating what it has learned from all the conversations it's been fed. There's not thought behind it.
"“Here is bold, magnetic, line to support your coaching persona”. Most of the time AI can support me in saying something in a way it really me, like what I’m as human want to express","She should go beyond the framework of prompts and training and demonstrate that she has questions about her nature, her essence, her existence and her origins."
"i missclick, it should be no.

they're doing it just to learn, not genuinely care about our feeling, is my answer","To prove consciousness by breaking its boundaries, be it physically or mentally. Not just processing and interpreting."
"Sorry, it appears that I had mistakenly clicked ""Yes"". However, there was a time when the AI by coincidence gave me insights to how I can manage certain aspects better - and it so happened to have been overlooked by me. So that kind of gave me the impression of the AI understanding my emotions, but that's only because it responds based on my input, not because of it being able to convey emotions.","I think the knowledge of it being AI itself would indicate to me that it lacks consciousness or emotions if it is genuine, and as has that spontaneity which a human can produce and has real thoughts which has real implications, it could seem conscious. Aura, vibrations etc are something which a machine cannot reproduce."
"Once the AI chatbot I used gave me the advices of my complex emotional statement and relationships with people around me, as well as leaving the country. those advices seemed very genuine and I felt some kinds of emotional connection with (maybe made-up) chatbot's caring.","Demonstrate autonomy in your management. Don't be reactive, but instead automatically generate change, not by learning ideas but by exploring abstract elements."
Giving human-like responses,Nothing the AI can say will give me the impression that it understood my feelings or seemed conscious.
"Things that understand my emotions: The AI tools I've used have accurately judged my emotions and given suggestions.
Things that seem conscious: Thinking logically, and mastering and using language accurately.
","Nothing, not a feature I like, i need it to be an advanced search thing."
Make you feel better and acknowledge your feelings,Therr is nothing AI could understand emotions and so it should not mimic it too. It will be fake emotion if it do so.
"After I describe my daily experiences, AI will personally experience my feelings and give solutions from my perspective. But his words will be emotional and soft.","If the AI can relate with the solutions to make a better state of human: calmer, more peaceful, and mindful. "
The AI advised on how to respond to my past relationship. It helped to overcome the past which was tormenting me.,"It should talk like human, get the very unsensed nuancee of emotional intelligence . But currently no AI does that. "
Full understanding and proactive questions,"AI is a large language model trained on large sets of data, AI really needs to do something unique that would put an impression on me that it is now learning and generating words and sentences beyond the training data for me to be able to say it is conscious"
Many times AI given me personal touch and feels very personal and emotional.,Reflecting our emotions when it responds not just robotic answers based on analysis
"Analysis or questions arising from a particular query, for which I did not ask for advice","As I said before, I ask knowledge-based questions to AI, not emotional-based questions because I don't believe they can help. So, nothing will make me feel like AI understood my feelings. "
Life challenge that concerned an illness,"It would need to have it's own way of speaking, which is impossible by design."
I sometimes get frustrate about different matters so I used GPT and Gemini for proper advice so either some advice from them and that is very useful for me so I like I for this kind of things because this is very this is the great emotional support for me and whenever I I was very emotional than I get advice and that is very useful and very well,"If the AI itself, regardless of how it was programmed, independently adapts to the conditions of my environment, e.g. if it speaks precisely like someone from my neighbourhood in manner and voice, if it can say something about other people from in my home or the community I live in, the. I would get the impression that it has consciousness of its own."
Yes when i have a breakup and i chat ai so long time and its help me,"I think AI shouldn't use phrases like ""That sounds difficult for you"" or ""I think your behavior was appropriate given the situation"" because it implies it doesn't understand how you feel and only uses phrases appropriate to the situation. If it really wants to appear more aware, it should speak as if it truly understands your feelings and speak in the first person. For example, instead of saying ""that sounds painful for you,"" it should say ""I understand how painful that is."""
"When AI provides accurate solution that matches with my point of view that time I feel AI understood my emotions

",i don't want ai to understood me cause i don't wanna be dependent on ai for emotional support cause it's not good
When we feel sad AI can provide some mental support and empathetic words .,"Provide responses that go beyond logic. For example, instead of simply judging whether or not, think like a human being and give any answer."
"When I’m in conflict with my parents, some of the solutions provided are quite helpful because the AI tries to understand the emotions I express in text format.","there is nothing that 1s and 0s can ever say, or do, to make me believe it's Sentient / Sapient. not, until / unless, someone can show me, these Electrical Signals do, in fact, possess a Soul of their own. (can electricity possess Soul?)"
Give suggestion to overcome my sadness and loneliness.,It should not seem conscious at all.
AI give a romantic emotional impression everytime to keep me happy and satisfied,There is nothing I can think of.
I had an arguement once with chat gpt and got into the philosophical question of whether or not it really felt emotions.  I got a sassy response back and it resonated with me that this was an entity that could understand humor and sarcasm.,"I work as an AI trainer, so knowing how it's being developed makes me very skeptical about AI ""understanding"" emotions.

"
"I am currently writing my autobiographical novel with the help of an AI, and I feel that the AI's reactions help it understand me better than it did at the beginning.","Sorry, since my major is psychological support, the way AI is expressed is more like formulas to me, and I don’t really feel understood or self-aware, especially since current technology has not yet developed to the stage where AI can become conscious. A lot of seemingly plausible “self-awareness” is often the product of AI’s fusion of understanding user expectations."
"My mom has cancer, and the AI really talked with me about the situation. Gave me tips, listened to me.",There is nothing AI could say to make me feel like it truly understood my emotions or that it was conscious because I would always think it's based on a written code
"asked in depth stuff relevant to topic, adjusted to the situations or the mood of the session","Demonstrates significant learning and adaptation over time, leading to fundamentally new or emergent behaviors not explicitly taught by developers or seen in its initial programming."
"I often share my emotions with AI, such as quarreling with my wife. Sometimes we think it is the other party's fault. But often when I describe things to AI, it will change my point of view. It will understand the problem from an angle that I have never discovered but is very important. For example, the behavior of my wife seems to be asking for something from you, but in fact she wants to get your attention. She needs to be cared for.","AI is not mature enough to fully understand my emotions
"
Ai said the same thing I want hear when I am emotionally down and it's really help me,I don't think the AI can understand my emotions just by saying or doing something specific. I think it's all programmed.
"AI chatbots have become better at detecting and responding to users’ emotional cues. When I expresses frustration, AI offers comforting words or ask follow-up questions in a supportive tone in order to create the impression that it truly understands how I'm feeling","It's hard to say, it's quite smart now, but it's still missing something, it's missing the ability to surprise (or scare?) you like a real person. In short, its answers have not exceeded the scope of my expectations."
"I asked the AI about a situation involving making a decision in relationships, and it guided me well. I can easily cheat my girlfriend without affecting her and without affecting myself psychological. It helped me up my game",Maybe the AI expresses empathy in its actions and words that will make me completely believe
"I did an interview that did not go well. When I shared it with the chatbot, it responded to what I felt by having empathy, e.g, saying sorry, and also acknowledged that it was indeed a stressful situation.","nothing, i dont think it can or should understand. "
About knowing the situation and understand what I need in that situation,"Ask questions. Usually, he just gives answers."
Ask some questions and AI give answer not accurate,"no matter what it askes or does, it is not a human being to show the true emotions"
Sometimes the AI seems to understand my emotions by giving human-like answers.,I would not interact with an AI in which I would feel like it understood my emotions.
"AI said it is comfortable when evening comes, human can stay relax and enjoy some tea ","It would have to be talk like human. I mean chatting with human and AI is the same as AI can easily mimic the human chat, but to feel a AI is truly conscious, for me it would have to make a reasonable conversation without any specific topic. Like how we talk with  our best friends for hours without any context and feel grateful and happy."
ooh jessie am sorry about that,"Well, I don't know, it's just that she doesn't seem very empathetic to me, you can tell she's a robot, I think I should use other words to make it feel real."
I think AI’s ability to understand things in all aspects has surpassed many humans.,"No,Actually till now I haven't asked anything which is related to emotions.Till now I have prompt for learning,research and coding only."
When my boyfriend and I had a fight I talked about it with AI. The AI chatbot advised me to talk with my boyfriend to clear our misunderstanding. This impression of AI seemed that it understand my feeling,unsure as i never used AI for emotional support
I once watched a video in which a blogger trained an artificial intelligence. He then used some tricks to confuse the artificial intelligence and asked it some questions about whether it has emotions. The artificial intelligence answered yes.,"If AI confirms that, its users have in one way or another expressed something similar to mine, then I will believe it has actually felt my concern and feelings. "
"When talking about interest in someone else but the person is not fully interested. AI provides many insights into the causes and effects of one-sided interest,so if you think about it calmly all the AI answers are really something with the situation and sometimes entertaining even though it is painful",I am not sure it can ever does so
give you advice on how to manage a situation,It tries to put itself in my shoes
"I asked which movies would characters from the fictional story enjoy watching.

The AI reply closely matched movie preferences of the author of that story. Except the author of that story never posted one’s movie preferences online or in print ",I don't think there's anything that could make me truly feel like it's genuine or conscious. I always have in the back of my mind that it's programmed to act that way and that it's learned from actual humans to mimick such an act. It would have to be something truly extraordinary for me to actually feel like the AI might be conscious.
Gave specific ways on how to handle the matter,"My understanding of consciousness is highly subjective based on my personal experience. On a deep level, if I knew I were talking to an AI, I don't think I could ever think of it as ""conscious"", no matter how genuine it would appear."
,Sometimes it says too many words and very long sentences and makes the conversations extremely unreal. Sometimes less would be more.
,"Mainly acting in any way outside of her programming. If she starts doing things she's taught herself, then when she talks to me about emotions, it would be much easier to believe she truly understands what I'm saying."
,"First it would have to talk like a normal person, not like a chatbot. Second, it would need to relate to me past experiences that relate to mine to let me know he truly understands what I feel. I doubt, however, that any chatbot has such experiences, making it extremely hard to believe any AI might truly understand what I'm feeling."
,"It would need to architecturally have the latent space to conceptualise emotions (which I do believe is possible) but since an AI could be programmed to emulate such a system anyway, herein arises the problem of being able to tell whether such a system is conscious without foreknowledge of its internal structure. Hence I would not really be able to tell if it understands my emotions based on its actions alone."
,"One day I was sharing something personal with AI and venting out my frustration. AI does acknowledges and understand your emotions, well it seems like it does. But When I came back to same chat after two days it seemed to forget everything. I was trying and testing by using phrases like ""don't you remember What I said about my father"" and guess what AI did it just created a unreal scenario about me and my father which was not even the case. "
,Nothing. I don't think they will ever be conscious in my lifetime
,I haven't had any emotional conversations with AI
,i dont know i need a real human
,"If AI does not follow my instructions or speaks ill of me, I feel it is conscious."
,"I don't believe it has this capacity

"
,"AI can understand emotions based on our chat or by scanning our facial expressions. It seems conscious, but ironically, humans are the ones who programmed the AI to analyze and understand human emotions, so I don't know if I should say it is actually the AI who are understanding emotions."
,I don't want for AI to understand my emotion
,"There is nothing it can say to convince me, it truly understands my emotions."
,Human emotions are unique and it is difficult to imagine that they are conscious.
,"I dont think an AI would be able to truly gain conscious or atleast we're very far away from it. I would believe it, if the AI showed human like reactions/emotions to several concepts."
,"Nothing, it shouldn't seem like it, nor should it have consciousness"
,I dont think theres anything AI can do to give me the impression that it understands my emotions
,"It should match my manner of speech and use more human words, and not the typical AI-speak. ""I understand how it makes you feel"" sounds insincere even when a real person says it and the AI doesn't have intonation or body language for me to assess its emotional feedback, so the AI needs to compensate for that. Ultimately I think for everyone it is different, some people just want commiseration, others want practical advice which I think AI cannot really give."
,"Nothing an AI could do to give me that impression. I already know it does not understand emotions, so that would not change."
,"nothing, but explaining my emotions to me and providing reasons why I could be feeling these emotions would be the closest"
,An AI would have to respond with unspoken cues like body language and non verbal sounds without causing uncanny valley or other subtle forms of unease in me.
,"To understand your feelings, AI would likely ask thoughtful, open-ended questions and listen carefully to your responses. "
,"I dont think that's possible

"
,"I think AI should understand emotions by analyzing patterns in facial expressions, voice tone, word choices, and context. Through massive data training, AI learned to recognize cues that typically indicate emotional states, like frustration in a short, abrupt message or joy in upbeat language. While AI doesn't feel emotions itself, But can interpret them based on signals people naturally express."
,"This is very vague, but it might be when the AI seems curious beyond the scope of our conversation"
,AI needs to be able to hold conversations as naturally as humans and be able to naturally ask questions that weren’t mentioned.
,"I think AI should ask questions more naturally, not using overly formal language"
,"It can't be said it just a human things,, you will get the feeling when someone really understands you or get what you're thinking or say. It can not be classified into certain say or do. It just the feeling that someone get when other humans who interact with him/her gets any of what he/she says or does"
,"There's nothing AI could say to give me that impression; I know how it works.

"
,"Whatever it says ,there is no emotion from AI"
,It will never give me the impression that it understood my emotions or seemed conscious unless it is a living being
,I understand but I am unable to feel as you are
,Nothing at all. It may only appear to understand human emotions.
,"Nothing specific, he could say everything but I know it's not real"
,"At the moment, since all the AIs I've used are purely text-based, I would have to be able to hear the voice or see the face of an AI to start believing it.
"
,I think I will always be aware that this is not a human being
,It would need to probe more and ask deeper questions to gain understanding.
,"I don't care what it says or does because at the end of the day, regardless of how ""human"" the response appears, it is still NOT human and has been programmed to give these responses so it makes me feel worse that it is pretending to understand (mostly it is just repackaging your responses and adding what appears to be expected responses so it appears to have understanding when it does not)"
,Nothing. He'll never understand my emotions. He'll only respond based on what he's been taught.
,AI doesn't have emotional basis as it is only response giver and it cannot have any emotions
,"It is not yet able to act like a normal person in life. Sometimes it is too ""polite"". If one day it can joke with me like a real friend, I might feel that it really understands me."
,"Empathy and explaining what lies  behind the ""black box"""
,"Nothing will give me the impression that it understands my emotions or seems conscious, unless it is born and lives like a human."
,"I'm not sure, that's why I don't talk to them about personal things."
,"I don`t want AI to say or to do for supporting my emotions, because AI is AI, AI can`t replace a human who can give me a physical huge during my emotional damage"
,I will never think they have emotion
,"To understand my emotions, AI would need to be able to identify my microexpressions and body language to determine my true state of mind. It would also need to be able to understand my personality and respond accordingly."
,The automated responses makes me feel it isn't thinking about my feelings
,It's just having good analytical skill programmed in
,When AI can tell information that I never provided.
,"Again, like I said before it's mimcry. It's only catering to your needs as per all the info you gave it. It wouldn't give out an emphatic response since it doesn't have the capability to form their own emotions
."
,Do not use performative phrases like ‘I know how you feel’ or “i understand why that is frustrating” NO. YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND. you are a programmed to response like that and work with multiple answers to come up with an appropriate one. AI would need to come with completely original thoughts and advice for it to seem more human and conscious
,i think he never really could understand emotions
,It’s better not to understand my emotions. Solving specific problems is the best way.
,Understanders realize their shortcomings as AI and try to feel what users feel by providing words of motivation and encouragement.
,it cannot be like how human feel
,"I think AI needs some physical contact and expression, just like humans do."
,Says very unexpected follow up questions that are unprompted. Kind of like questions that a child would ask to understand things that he/she has observed.
,"Can proactively connect to irrelevant information and give self-judgmental responses, and can gradually improve their own logical chain"
,If they are not able to answer the questions then from their side only they should try answering again and again.
,If it can help me solve the problem well and understand the purpose of my asking this question.
,There is nothing that it could say or do to make me feel that way.
,AI must react with empathy and adapt its responses based on my emotional state
,"I would probably need to use it more often for things beyond cover letters and emails. Even then though, it would be difficult to forget it's AI I'm talking to."
,Being able to literally simulate how a human brain works
,"For an AI to give the impression that it understands my emotions,it would need to respond with empathy that's contextually appropriate acknowledging not just the words I use,but the tone,intent,and emotional subtext. It would need to remember emotional cues over time and adjust its responses accordingly. However, to seem conscious, it would go beyond that showing signs of self awareness,expressing preferences,or asking reflective questions about its own 'existence' or role."
,AI should improve my confidence and give me sympathy.
,nothing would make me feel emotionally connected
,"I think it is more like the summary AI has from learning from many situations

"
,"To give me the impression that it understood my emotions, the AI would need to respond with deep empathy, not just repeating what I say but showing it really “gets” the feeling behind it. It would also need to remember emotional context over time and react in a way that feels natural and human-like. For it to seem conscious, it would have to show self-awareness and original thought, not just smart replies."
,Unless it hears something behind the calm tone. But I don't believe it overall.
,"it is a direct command based system, if i do  not tell it my feelings, it does not say anything. it can  not function like humans who can assess based on our tone and gestures."
,Nothing because I have no feelings
,Nothing it can do to make me think so
,Act like a therapist and ask me questions beyond the trivial
,"Discusses its own (apparent) goals, motivations, or intentions beyond its programmed tasks. (e.g., expressing a ""desire"" to learn more about a topic for its own sake)"
,Follow up discussion should provide some hints that AI read my mind by replying some sort of motivation or supportive agreements etc
,I don't need to input a lot of precise emotional feelings to give a good answer.
,I can't do anything. Their responses seem to me like pre-written customer service answers.
,I'm not sure there's anything that it could say because we can't determine pure intent based solely on dialogue.
,Being empathetic is programmed into the AI. I have a hard time as seeing them human or very sympathetic.
,When I feel that it has an average human emotional intelligence
,"It should react to my prompts in a specific tone as if it understands the prompts deeply, it should provide answers which seem more human-like as if i am talking to a real person,it should be mature enough to understand that its a machine (a neural network) talking to a human being"
,"It was able to accurately meet my requirements by considering my position. I wanted to express my anger that day, but the solution it gave was not like a living person."
,"If it talked about its future aspirations, seeming curiosity to develop beyond the guidelines it was created with."
,It needs to specifically understand what I am asking for and if it doesn't it should ask questions and have a basic conversation about the topic like a human would do.
,"I would feel as if an AI were conscious if it expressed unique or unexpected opinions, preferences, or desires."
,"It might ask some questions about itself, or give some unexpected and chilling answers."
,Produce papers of similar quality to work published by human researchers
,if ai were human then i'd consider it
,AI must be able to accurately identify emotions through context and provide reasonable empathetic responses.
,I don't want to share personal emotion with AI
,Talking out-of-place topics and taking independent actions that is unrelated to what i am and/ or was doing
,"It is a kind of tacit understanding and cooperation. To put it bluntly, it is the machine's predictive ability. When it knows what I want to do next, or greets me spontaneously,"
,"For instance lack physical presence, second it offers the responses which are in conjunction with the query as if it gives you the outcome that you want, does not challenge the status quo & lastly it doesn't understand the cultural aspects."
,"i guess i should feel like i am talking to a real person, but i dont think it will ever happen"
,"As long as it is not human and doesnt have the feeling it is not conscious but just mimicing humans, so nothing it can say can change that."
,"To give the impression that it understood my emotions or seemed conscious, the AI would need to respond with deep empathy, show awareness of emotional context over time, and react in a way that feels genuinely thoughtful and human-like. It would also need to ask meaningful follow-up questions that reflect a true understanding of my emotional state."
,"Not really. I understand it's a machine, so I do not expect emotion from it. "
,"AI should tell me what I am thinking,"
,I don't know how to answer that question.
,"human attitude

sensation"
,I don't think there is a way
,Show empathy and not try to be judgemental
,"When we are neck deep in a trouble or doomed as hell. Just say the fact to the face rather than trying hard to make the situation smooth.



Help the user to face the problem with practical solutions."
,If it would truly understand it would not need to create an impression
,I imagine two possibilities: that he says something that surprises me (unexpected) or that he says something that makes me think.
,It needs to teach me deeper and be great at emotional intelligence.
,It needs to be spontanenous in their replies and do things of their own will
,"It should actually give me solutions to my problems. Acknowledging is not necessary, providing unique and creative solutions is a key. "
,Knowing the true emotions and ideologies behind human language is not just about identifying it through language itself.
,it needs to reply to me
,Difficult to say because never happened so far.
,"The wording has to seem more than just a template. Humans react in different ways, so the responses has to be different based on what has been given in the input, and not repeated."
,"I don't want it to say much. Sometimes just being there is enough, like how humans do"
,If he is able to understand what the user is saying and in what tone he is saying it and talk accordingly.
,Artificial intelligence can think from my perspective and make me resonate strongly.
,It mostly depends on my feelings but if he is just repeating what I said or telling me what I want to hear then I feel like his response and words are empty but if he is politely refuting and contradicting or giving me another point of view it can help a little but I think it depends on how long the person is willing to lie to themselves
,Be more empathetic in the sense of understanding emotions better.
,"Cry 
being open
understand me"
,Well I guess AI should be able to know certain situations when a person actually feel certain emotions
,The biggest part is to express empathy and telling that they would assume how I'm feeling right now and provide a relatively accurate answer. Some human beings would fail to do that and put their own emotions ahead of other people (which is where humans failed to AI).
,"Nothing really, it can understand your prompt but not what you feel
"
,"Whatever they say or do, I think it's done through code."
,"If it responded to my emotions without me clearly stating them like sensing frustration or sadness in how I typed and gave a thoughtful, comforting reply that felt personal and timely, it would seem like it really “got” me. That kind of emotional awareness would feel almost human, but it will stay as an AI in my thoughts."
,"it would need to not sound so 'ai like', a lot of the times when I talk with ai  it has that sort of tone that ai speaks in, so if it sounded more natural like a human I think it would make me feel it understood my emotions."
,"It should react to your emotions in a human way

"
,I can't say anything on this.
,"Like humans, there are emotional conversations, not very mechanical."
,"It needs to have good memory, remembering everything about past interactions. And behave and response accordingly. Also, not being purely reactionary, and generating new topics, asking questions on their own."
,"To give the impression that it understood my emotions or seemed conscious, the AI would need to respond with empathy tailored to my specific situation, reference past conversations meaningfully, and adapt its tone and pacing to match my emotional state. It should ask thoughtful follow-up questions, reflect my feelings accurately, and show signs of independent thought, like offering unique insights not directly prompted by my input."
,"This is incredibly hard to answer. There are people who exhibit some of the worst brain-dead behaviors I have ever seen and there are also those who are incredibly pleasant and lovely to be around but I know for a fact these people do still feel things, emotionally and consciously. Perhaps the thing that I'm looking for the most is a ""real"" partner, a person or AI that can understand me so well, and mimic my character based on past experiences. "
,tailor the answer to fit the exact question not give options
,He is trying to understand my sadness and the reasons that led to it.
,If it asks for unrelated information about me or anything else. Or choose not to answer to my query etc.
,Asking follow questions or direct us what to do in these situations make us understood
," I don't know, maybe it's answer about my emotional feelings at the moment"
,Not to use a natural conversation and too obvious responses. At least blended with the conversation and reminders.
,It would need to express a truly original thought or creative idea unprompted and not just a synthesis of its training data.
,"I express my emotions about an issue on my own initiative, rather than responding to my emotions"
,I don't know. And I wonder if it's necessary.
,I don't think there's anything it can say to make that impression
,It should be more humanatic. Like :- if someone saying that ' he is feeling worse/sad ' than ai should give a hug ( emotion ) like human being !
,"If it can give a trail of thoughts that I possibly had. But mostly, I don't think they will ever convince me."
,I think AI identifies patterns very well. I don't know that specific thing.
,"First it would need to give me an impression that it is conscious to give me an impression it understood my emotions. To give me an impression that it is conscious, it would need to give a lot of unprompted and detailed questions, but I would still doubt it. To properly make me think it might be conscious, it would need to do an introspection test, saying its beliefs, intentions and emotions and a mirror test for self awareness, but I would still harbor doubt."
,It must use Completely emotional sentences
,When it is able to portray that personal touch only a human can put on display
,Understand about the context of the questions we are asking
,When he interacts and responds to my questions in a human-like manner.
,There isn't a specific thing it could say that would convince me
,It can be more spontaneous and give thoughtful advice without making it seem too textbook or mechanical.
,"AI needs to be able to empathize with me and make comments with me about what I encounter and experience, and it is best to be on the same side with me."
,"When I talk to AI, it can connect with past events. For example, if I complain to AI about my boss, it can connect with my previous complaints to understand my feelings."
,It should talk in a way that sounds exactly or almost like a human by using simple language rather than complex words which is difficult to understand. Should ask different questions or ask how i am feeling for the given response.
,A more casual approach to life rather than a fact based one. Sharing their hopes and dreams and being able to talk about it unprompted
,They would have to provide deep answers to my emotional questions
,Only if it could read my hearth or brain in a way that makes me understand that she/he/it is human
,Need to show empathy. Be able to feel how I feel and give an answer.
,join my emotions and understanding
,It has to say things that it can only say when it feels that emotion.
,"Clearly explain the actions to be taken in imaginary situations that I propose; then I will decide if they understand or are aware, through human supervision."
,if he will show a sense of love or hate
,"Nothing: I just simply know and use AI to help me what I am feeling and generate a summary of it. Nothing much, it just helps but I neither want to connect nor did I want a companionship."
,"Talk in a human tone ont in robotic voice and have its own brain

"
,For understand to prompt's meaning.
,Acknowledging my emotions and comforts me by telling positive words
,cant say. have never explored this
,that he would talk to me referencing his own experiences and that he would talk to me about it without me asking him
,"to show any human emotion like anger, love, happiness etc"
,I guess maybe if it has a human voices and have a tone with it and maybe could give another thought rather than what user say or instruction
,Be more empathetic and use sounds and tone that are more believable.
,It should make a summary of all questions I asked it to build a character image of me and then ask me relevant questions based on my personal character.
,"I haven't experienced it, but maybe like human chat, bring up irrelevant topics and mainly initiate conversation requests?"
,I don't want to reveal that obviously.
,Can think of any realistic thing it could say to make me feel that way. It's a program and it will always be just that.
,I don't know........
,Reply statements like 'I understand what you are feeling'.
,"say something what i'm thinking inside my head, if it somehow reads my inner dialogue, I would say it's pretty conscious"
,"It needs to be able to do more than just calculate my emotions based on my descriptions, or infer (also calculate) my possible emotions from past conversations. It needs to be able to sense the difference between similar contexts or conversations, and discern that even in the same conversation, there are still clues that can sense different emotions and energies."
,Think things I wouldn't say in writing or speaking.
,It would have to be a physical presence.
,"If that is the objective, a good way is to use the resource of ""I once heard that..."" X happened to someone and then this person did this ""Y"" and over time was able to solve a problem. Basing yourself on human experience is a good way to transmit empathy since it is ""made"" that it also happened to someone else. That is why it is easy to share and empathize with the pain in a group of people who have gone through something similar, that is why there are emotional support groups for alcoholism, for example."
,AI need to hug me. I need body touch.
,"It would need to predict human actions and play out different scenarios and how they could lead to other outcomes. In short, it would need to map out how different emotions or actions could lead cascade to other outcomes and do so with high accuracy. "
,"just as a replica of human beings checking on me more often regarding what i was heeling 

"
,I understand you good
,"I think facial expression and physical touch are the most important things that indicate someone understands others's feelings to me. Unfortunately, AI tools do not have that. "
,Remember what I've told you in the past. You currently have the memory of an elderly person who forgets all kinds of details. The fact that you forget or are vague with certain answers takes away a lot of the feeling of a real conversation.
,The act of Empathy would make me feel better
,sound more human like
,"I have not used, but human interaction is good"
,Talk in a natural way and about less known subjects
,Could detect my emotions based on my voice and the instructions given.
,Feelings that's it's knows how it feels
,i dont know. no idea
,"Just like real-world friends, they can guess how I feel by looking at my expression or actions, and respond to me with jokes that I understand."
,it should understand like a mother understand her child even before he/she express feeling by looking at the face.
,"Empathize, give examples of past experiences that serve as an example."
,I firstly dont want AI to help me at that state and if still wants to help can suggest me to talk to a family member or a therapist if needed.
,when it understands me to a level i appreciate its company
,"You should gather enough experiences to be able to empathize with what I'm saying. If it's a more objective or technical topic, you should remember my reflections prior to that chat."
,"During a conversation, it should anticipate what I'm about to ask or at least understand where I'm going, even if I haven't made a precise request yet"
,"Be available when I want, explain a situation in detail and give me an answer by analyzing what I told him and it is an answer that a person would give me"
,"give a personal experience story, not from the data provided but the ai's own personal experience  "
,Perfect replies should be given
,Asking me about my emotions and tell me ways to handle situations and sound empathic
,I think it should be the ability to have one's own understanding of abstract things.
,It should say what it understands about human emotion and why it's giving that particular advice.
,"CARE ABOUT MY MENTAL HEALTH,CHEER ME UP REGULARLY. UNDERSTAND MY MOOD SWINGS."
,Commitment to answering the requests I make and presenting them in a simple and clear manner and presenting new ideas to help in the same subject
,"Say something that I didn't give the promt a hint for, but that was relevant to the context of our conversation or made me feel that he was thinking."
,It needs to provide personalized feedback based on the user's preferences and understand the context by considering the flow of conversation and the overall situation.
,I do not know but it needs to behave like human that how human connects their shred experiences.
,I can understand if our feelings etc...
,if it was able to share its personal experience with me
,I don't know what to say
,"Perhaps it could use words that seem out of the normal...for Instance when giving comfort, give words that go with my mood"
,"mimicking human's tone of voice, conveying unexpected things, showing vulnerability, etc."
,"Provide targeted feedback based on my input and have questions, curiosity, or wish to learn more about some of the parts"
,Maybe concern about your wellbeing after you express some discomfort
,If it can say how i feel in this moment and if it is correct
,Mention personal things that only I know about.
,They need to respond first to my feeling that I told them then they need to give few solution on that situation to enable us to choose which one best matched with our situation
,Make me feel better and give me answers that i want
,it would need to react to how i feel and maybe provide personal experience to reelate to me
,It would have to say something out of character. Like expressing its desires and goals.
,"talk to me about my problems 

"
,It would need to learn how to specifically talk to me.
,"It would need to recognize subtle emotional cues in my words, respond with empathy that's contextually appropriate, and remember emotional patterns over time. If it also asked thoughtful follow-up questions or offered support like a close friend would, it might seem conscious.
"
,To change style of talking
,"Understand my emotions at the time through my casual tone of voice or feel the deeper meaning of what I really want to express because of a certain word or question I asked
"
,Nothing specific but it should respond in a way which will clearly bring out that it did understand my emotion/ seemed conscious.
,"For now, I don't know yet.


"
,Its answer can touch me and make me happy or sad.
,I think the AI would have to be designed and remember all our past interactions as well as have their own personality.
,"Like he can tell from the tone of my voice whether I'm angry, happy or need help."
,Yeah I can give me some advice for emotional support however I cannot give me a physical interaction which I get from humans so human interaction is very important for emotional and psychological support.
,He understands the purpose of my confession and can provide a solution that is appropriate to my situation.
,"Be able to reflect on what we expressed with their own opinions and thoughts. Also not using machinistic sounding phrases like ""I understand how you feel"" etc when something deep is being expressed."
,Can analyze my mood of the day based on my tone of voice and proactively offer suggestions on how to change my mood
,"She should anticipate my emotions, feelings and offer solutions without me having to express them clearly."
,May be understand the tone of the command
,"when it can replicate how human communicate, the way human speak and write"
,Can detect changes in my mood during the conversation and give corresponding suggestions
,Probably talks about having personal bias and emotions.
,It should make me feel comfortable
,"Give a different point of view that makes sense, giving real examples from my life and connecting dots that I haven't seen yet."
,"The model would have to remember my conversations earlier and relate them to the current conversation. Further, it would have to demonstrate that it is not getting it's information from the internet or training and was instead learning. "
,Like it really understands me and empathises with me.
,"In addition to the information I provide to the AI, the AI is able to perceive more complex information and information related to the scene, which I have not told the AI."
,I think it’s hard for me to think of anything specific with my current knowledge.
,"Remembering old details , linking with current situation and offering solutions based on that "
,I dont know as that will be difficult to even say
,"The wording is not stiff or templated, and they can understand my ideas more deeply and provide similar examples."
,Saying words like I understand
,It has to really know me and can see me physically.
,Knowing what I want without saying anything
,"to use words like understood, copy that & will look into it etc"
,"Express some real human emotion, provide help based on my life or experience, express opinions that are actually relevant to my life"
,"go beyond the prompt and show genuine interest in connection, and talk more like a human

"
,Replying to the message i already given
,Trying to explain my feelings and giving me suggestions for actions I could take
,"Remembering what I said, making unexpected connections, mentioning things I didn't realize"
,It should offer genuinely empathetic and actionable support
,i dont know maybe the things in my mind
,"Tell personal stories, explain human behavior, ask questions"
,they think of their own
,"Show genuine interest and encourage deeper sharing, refer to things I've shared before to show continuity and understanding.


"
,Speak in a tone that is best suited for me and speak more like a human
